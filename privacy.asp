            <div>We are committed to safeguarding the privacy of our website visitors; this policy  sets out how we will treat your personal information.</p>
                <p><b>(1) What information do we collect?</b></p>

                <p>We use cookies on this website. A cookie is a text file sent by a web server to a web browser, and stored by the browser. The text file is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser.</p>

We may use the information we obtain from the cookie in the administration of this website, to improve the website's usability and for marketing purposes. We may also use that information to [recognise your computer when you visit our website, and to personalise our website for you].</p>
                <p>Most browsers allow you to refuse to accept cookies. (For example, in Internet Explorer you can refuse all cookies by clicking Tools, Internet Options, Privacy, and selecting Block all cookies using the sliding selector.) This will, however, have a negative impact upon the usability of many websites.</p>
