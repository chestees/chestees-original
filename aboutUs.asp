            <H1>It all began...</H1>
            <p>24 years ago in a small fishing village nestled deep in the mountains of Costa Rica. A young boy whose parents named "Pico" was born 3 months late. A hefty baby at an impressive 12 pounds 2 ounces, Pico was groomed from day one to be a provider and survivor. He had to. Sadly, his mother did not survive birthing a 12 pound baby in the high regions of Belize. What was she doing in Belize? Pico's parents wanted the best for him by birthing him into dual citizenship due to Belize's generous welfare system and Costa Rica's abundance of shallow water crabs. Pico's parent's figured both would be useful at some point in Pico's life.</p>
            <p>Years went by and young Pico grew up a strong young man providing for his elderly father, 7 sisters, 4 nieces, 2 nephews and a son. He followed in his fathers footsteps and joined the local fishing union. But after 6 months, Pico came to the realization that he would never be able to meet an real american blonde "bombshell" he has dreamt of ever since he found a May 1987 Playboy magazine in the officer's cabin of a shipwrecked Indian whaling vessel. Thus began Pico's northern bound journey to the U.S.A.</p>
            <p>It took four and a half grueling years, of which I won't bore you with the exciting stories that took place, but Pico finally made his way up to Santa Clara, California. Pico quickly found a job in the entertainment industry as a set trailer maintenance man. The pay was decent and Pico got to stare at many beautiful actors, but he wanted more. Again, sparing you the boring details, Pico found his calling in t-shirts. Not just ordinary t-shirts. Fashionable t-shirts. Extraordinary t-shirts. Funny t-shirts.</p>
            <p style="border-top:1px dashed #b93636; padding-top:10px;">Who am I kidding. I'm a dude from Indiana who loves printing t-shirts.</p>
